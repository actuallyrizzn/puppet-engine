# Puppet Engine Python Port Project Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for porting the Puppet Engine from JavaScript to Python. The port will maintain all existing functionality while leveraging Python's ecosystem and best practices.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure (Week 1)

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] Create new Python project structure
- [ ] Set up virtual environment management (poetry/pipenv)
- [ ] Initialize git repository with Python-specific .gitignore
- [ ] Set up Python linting and formatting (black, flake8)
- [ ] Configure testing framework (pytest)

### 1.2 Dependency Management
- [ ] Create requirements.txt/poetry.lock
- [ ] Map JavaScript dependencies to Python equivalents:
  - Twitter API: tweepy
  - Solana: solana-py
  - Async operations: asyncio
  - Database: SQLAlchemy/asyncpg
  - Configuration: python-dotenv

## Phase 2: Core Components Port (Weeks 2-3)

### 2.1 Agent Management System
- [ ] Port agent base class and interfaces
- [ ] Implement agent state management
- [ ] Port agent behavior system
- [ ] Implement agent interaction logic
- [ ] Port memory system

### 2.2 Twitter Integration
- [ ] Port Twitter API client
- [ ] Implement tweet generation system
- [ ] Port mention monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] Port interaction handling

### 2.3 Event Engine
- [ ] Port event system architecture
- [ ] Implement event triggers
- [ ] Port event handlers
- [ ] Implement event scheduling
- [ ] Port random event generation

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 4-5)

### 3.1 Solana Integration
- [ ] Port Solana wallet management
- [ ] Implement trading logic
- [ ] Port market data integration
- [ ] Implement safety controls
- [ ] Port trading tweet generation

### 3.2 Memory and State Management
- [ ] Port persistent storage system
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Port state synchronization
- [ ] Implement backup/restore functionality

### 3.3 LLM Integration
- [ ] Port OpenAI integration
- [ ] Implement Grok integration
- [ ] Port prompt management system
- [ ] Implement response processing

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Week 6)

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Write tests for core components
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Port existing test cases
- [ ] Add new test coverage

### 4.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark critical paths
- [ ] Test concurrent operations
- [ ] Validate memory usage
- [ ] Test rate limiting

### 4.3 Security Audit
- [ ] Review API key handling
- [ ] Audit wallet security
- [ ] Review data storage
- [ ] Implement security best practices

## Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment (Week 7)

### 5.1 Documentation
- [ ] Port existing documentation
- [ ] Create Python-specific guides
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide

### 5.2 Deployment
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create Docker configuration
- [ ] Document deployment process

## Technical Considerations

### Python-Specific Optimizations
- Use asyncio for concurrent operations
- Implement proper type hints
- Use dataclasses for configuration
- Leverage Python's context managers
- Implement proper exception handling

### Performance Considerations
- Use connection pooling for databases
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Optimize memory usage
- Implement proper logging

### Security Considerations
- Secure API key storage
- Implement proper authentication
- Secure wallet management
- Data encryption at rest
- Input validation

## Migration Strategy

### Step-by-Step Migration
1. Port core components first
2. Maintain feature parity
3. Add Python-specific improvements
4. Validate functionality
5. Deploy incrementally

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for workflows
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Security audits
5. User acceptance testing

## Timeline
- Total Duration: 7 weeks
- Buffer for unexpected issues: 1 week
- Total Project Timeline: 8 weeks

## Success Criteria
- All existing features ported successfully
- Performance meets or exceeds JavaScript version
- All tests passing
- Documentation complete
- Security audit passed
- Successful deployment

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. Library compatibility issues
2. Performance bottlenecks
3. Security vulnerabilities
4. Data migration challenges
5. API rate limiting issues

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Early prototype of critical components
2. Regular performance testing
3. Security reviews
4. Backup and rollback plans
5. Rate limit monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Begin core component porting
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Begin documentation updates
